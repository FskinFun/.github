**FskinFun** is a decentralized finance (DeFi) protocol designed to tokenize Steam Market items, particularly **CS2 cases and skins**, by converting them into blockchain assets. This project introduces liquidity, transparency, and new financial opportunities for in-game items through the power of Web3 and decentralized trading.

---

## Overview

FskinFun allows users to transform their CS2 items into digital assets:
- **CS Cases** are tokenized as ERC20 tokens, providing fungible assets for DeFi trading.
- **CS Skins** are tokenized as ERC721 NFTs, offering unique, non-fungible assets for collectors and traders.

This enables players to use their Steam items in a decentralized ecosystem, from trading and staking to leveraging DeFi protocols and marketplaces.

## Key Features

- **Tokenization**: Convert CS cases into ERC20 tokens and CS skins into ERC721 NFTs.
- **Minting and Redemption**: Simple minting and redemption process for users to interact with both Steam and Web3.
- **Oracle Integration**: On-chain Oracle system records key data such as token quantities and redemption cooldowns.
- **Transparent Vault Management**: All Steam accounts associated with FskinFun are public and verifiable.
- **DEX Integration**: Trade tokenized items on decentralized exchanges like Uniswap for ERC20 tokens and OpenSea for ERC721 NFTs.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- A Web3 wallet (e.g., MetaMask) to interact with the FskinFun protocol.
